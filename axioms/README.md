# Axioms Layer

This layer contains atomic capabilities - the foundational building blocks.

## Structure
- `git/` - Git operation axioms
- `version/` - Version management axioms
- `release/` - Release process axioms
- `github/` - GitHub-specific axioms

Each axiom is defined as an FCM (Formal Conceptual Model) file.

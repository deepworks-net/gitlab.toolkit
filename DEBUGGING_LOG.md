# Debugging Log - Persistent Issue Tracking

## Issue #1: GitHub Mirror Authentication Failure
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅

### Problem:
- GitHub mirror push operations failing with 403 "Permission denied"
- Authentication worked for pull/clone but failed for push
- Error: `remote: Permission to deepworks-net/gitlab.toolkit.git denied to mattbuske.`

### Root Cause:
Fine-grained personal access token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) had repository selection restrictions for organization repositories, even though it had Contents: Read/Write permissions.

### Solution:
Switched to classic personal access token (`GITLAB_ACCESS`) which doesn't have repository selection restrictions.

### Changes Made:
- `scripts/mirror_operations.py:24`: Changed to `os.environ.get('GITLAB_ACCESS', '') or os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN', '')`
- `scripts/test_github_auth.py`: Updated all instances to check `GITLAB_ACCESS` first

### Things Eliminated (DO NOT SUGGEST AGAIN):
1. ✅ Token permissions (had read/write)
2. ✅ Repository existence 
3. ✅ User access to repository
4. ✅ Authentication format
5. ✅ GitHub CLI installation
6. ✅ Git configuration
7. ✅ URL format issues
8. ✅ Branch protection rules
9. ✅ Basic permission issues

### Lesson Learned:
Fine-grained tokens require explicit repository selection for organization repos, even public ones. Classic tokens work universally for accessible repositories.

## Cleanup Actions Completed:
- ✅ No test files were created during debugging
- ✅ Reverted unnecessary GitLab CI workflow changes (jobs were disabled anyway)
- ✅ Kept working changes in scripts/mirror_operations.py and scripts/test_github_auth.py
- ✅ All debugging artifacts cleaned up

## Final State:
- Working solution: Scripts now use GITLAB_ACCESS token (classic) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN (fine-grained)
- GitLab CI workflow restored to original state
- Repository clean and ready for production use

## Issue #2: Disable GitHub Auth Test from CI Pipeline
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅

### Problem:
GitHub authentication test script running in CI pipeline when not needed

### Solution:
Disabled the test job inclusion in `.gitlab-ci.yml` while preserving the script for future use

### Changes Made:
- `.gitlab-ci.yml:14`: Commented out inclusion of `test-github-auth.yml`
- Script `scripts/test_github_auth.py` preserved for future debugging needs

## Issue #3: Missing TARGET_REPO Environment Variable
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: IN PROGRESS 🔄

### Problem:
Mirror workflow fails because `TARGET_REPO` environment variable is not set
Error: `❌ TARGET_REPO environment variable is required`

### Root Cause:
The mirror script expects `TARGET_REPO` but it's not defined in the GitLab CI environment variables

### Solution:
Set `TARGET_REPO` in the GitLab CI template that defines mirror operations

### Changes Made:
- `.gitlab-ci/templates/mirror-operations.yml:38`: Set `TARGET_REPO: 'gitlab.toolkit'` (repository name, not full URL)

### Status: RESOLVED ✅

### Issue #3b: TARGET_REPO as Full URL Caused Token Mangling
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅

### Problem:
Using full URL as TARGET_REPO caused the script to mangle the authentication token when building the target URL

### Root Cause:
Script logic expects TARGET_REPO to be just the repository name, not a full URL. When it's a URL, the token insertion logic breaks.

### Solution:
Reverted TARGET_REPO to empty string to use GitLab CI/CD variable set in repository settings

### Issue #3c: GitLab CI/CD Variable Not Found
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS 🔄

### Problem:
Even with TARGET_REPO empty in template, GitLab CI still shows `Repository: ` (empty)

### Root Cause Options:
1. TARGET_REPO CI/CD variable not set in GitLab repository settings
2. Variable set with different name 
3. Variable has wrong scope/protection settings
4. Branch-specific variable restrictions (unlikely but possible)

### Need to check:
- GitLab repository Settings > CI/CD > Variables
- Verify TARGET_REPO variable exists and value
- Check if variable is protected/masked and affects availability

## Issue #4: Hardcoded GitHub Organization
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅

### Problem:
`GITHUB_ORG` is hardcoded to "deepworks-net" in scripts, needs to be configurable

### Solution:
Added `GITHUB_ORG: ''` to GitLab CI template variables so it can be set via GitLab CI/CD variables

### Changes Made:
- `.gitlab-ci/templates/mirror-operations.yml:39`: Added `GITHUB_ORG: ''` variable

### Required CI/CD Variables:
Both of these now need to be set in GitLab repository Settings > CI/CD > Variables:
- `TARGET_REPO`: GitHub repository URL or name
- `GITHUB_ORG`: GitHub organization name (e.g., "deepworks-net")

## Issue #5: Staging Branch Missing TARGET_REPO (Main Branch Works)
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: DEBUGGING 🔍

### Problem:
- Main branch: Mirror works correctly
- Staging branch: Fails with missing TARGET_REPO variable
- Same GitLab CI/CD variables should be available to all branches

### Debug Actions:
Added extensive debug logging to `scripts/mirror_operations.py:391-403` to print:
- Key environment variables (TARGET_REPO, GITHUB_ORG, tokens, etc.)
- All CI_ prefixed variables
- This will help identify what's different between main and staging branch runs

### Debug Results:
Staging branch shows ALL required variables are missing:
- `TARGET_REPO`: `` (empty)
- `GITHUB_ORG`: `` (empty) 
- `GITLAB_ACCESS`: `NOT_SET`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: `NOT_SET`

### Root Cause:
GitLab CI/CD variables are not being passed to the job environment on staging branch.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Variables are "Protected"** - Only available to protected branches, and staging is not protected
2. **Variable scope restrictions** - Variables limited to specific branches/tags
3. **Variables don't exist** - Not actually configured in GitLab repository settings

### Root Cause CONFIRMED:
Variables are marked as "Protected" in GitLab CI/CD settings

### Solution:
Uncheck "Protected" flag for variables: `TARGET_REPO`, `GITHUB_ORG`, `GITLAB_ACCESS`
- This allows them to be available to all branches, not just protected ones
- Keep "Masked" checked for security on sensitive variables like `GITLAB_ACCESS`

### Status: RESOLVED ✅

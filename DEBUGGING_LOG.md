# Debugging Log - Persistent Issue Tracking

## Issue #1: GitHub Mirror Authentication Failure
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Problem:
- GitHub mirror push operations failing with 403 "Permission denied"
- Authentication worked for pull/clone but failed for push
- Error: `remote: Permission to deepworks-net/gitlab.toolkit.git denied to mattbuske.`

### Root Cause:
Fine-grained personal access token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) had repository selection restrictions for organization repositories, even though it had Contents: Read/Write permissions.

### Solution:
Switched to classic personal access token (`GITLAB_ACCESS`) which doesn't have repository selection restrictions.

### Changes Made:
- `scripts/mirror_operations.py:24`: Changed to `os.environ.get('GITLAB_ACCESS', '') or os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN', '')`
- `scripts/test_github_auth.py`: Updated all instances to check `GITLAB_ACCESS` first

### Things Eliminated (DO NOT SUGGEST AGAIN):
1. ‚úÖ Token permissions (had read/write)
2. ‚úÖ Repository existence 
3. ‚úÖ User access to repository
4. ‚úÖ Authentication format
5. ‚úÖ GitHub CLI installation
6. ‚úÖ Git configuration
7. ‚úÖ URL format issues
8. ‚úÖ Branch protection rules
9. ‚úÖ Basic permission issues

### Lesson Learned:
Fine-grained tokens require explicit repository selection for organization repos, even public ones. Classic tokens work universally for accessible repositories.

## Cleanup Actions Completed:
- ‚úÖ No test files were created during debugging
- ‚úÖ Reverted unnecessary GitLab CI workflow changes (jobs were disabled anyway)
- ‚úÖ Kept working changes in scripts/mirror_operations.py and scripts/test_github_auth.py
- ‚úÖ All debugging artifacts cleaned up

## Final State:
- Working solution: Scripts now use GITLAB_ACCESS token (classic) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN (fine-grained)
- GitLab CI workflow restored to original state
- Repository clean and ready for production use

## Issue #2: Disable GitHub Auth Test from CI Pipeline
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Problem:
GitHub authentication test script running in CI pipeline when not needed

### Solution:
Disabled the test job inclusion in `.gitlab-ci.yml` while preserving the script for future use

### Changes Made:
- `.gitlab-ci.yml:14`: Commented out inclusion of `test-github-auth.yml`
- Script `scripts/test_github_auth.py` preserved for future debugging needs

## Issue #3: Missing TARGET_REPO Environment Variable
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: IN PROGRESS üîÑ

### Problem:
Mirror workflow fails because `TARGET_REPO` environment variable is not set
Error: `‚ùå TARGET_REPO environment variable is required`

### Root Cause:
The mirror script expects `TARGET_REPO` but it's not defined in the GitLab CI environment variables

### Solution:
Set `TARGET_REPO` in the GitLab CI template that defines mirror operations

### Changes Made:
- `.gitlab-ci/templates/mirror-operations.yml:38`: Set `TARGET_REPO: 'gitlab.toolkit'` (repository name, not full URL)

### Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Issue #3b: TARGET_REPO as Full URL Caused Token Mangling
**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Problem:
Using full URL as TARGET_REPO caused the script to mangle the authentication token when building the target URL

### Root Cause:
Script logic expects TARGET_REPO to be just the repository name, not a full URL. When it's a URL, the token insertion logic breaks.

### Solution:
Reverted TARGET_REPO to empty string to use GitLab CI/CD variable set in repository settings

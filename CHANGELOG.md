# gitlab.toolkit Repository Changelog
*Note: the changes in this log track the development of GitLab CI/CD toolkit mirroring github.toolkit functionality*

## **Initial Release - v0.1.0**
### What's Implemented
- **FCM Bridge System**: Created `.gitlab-bridge/generator.py` to transform FCMs into GitLab CI/CD templates
- **Shell Runner Support**: Full compatibility with GitLab shell runners
- **File Operations**: Complete implementation with runtime script and comprehensive test suite (14 tests)
- **Git Operations**: Generated GitLab CI templates for branch, tag, and commit operations
- **Robust Dependency Management**: Graceful fallback handling for missing pip/pip3
- **Same FCM Sources**: Uses github.toolkit FCMs as single source of truth via git submodule
- **Architecture**: Implements Layer 1 (Axioms) of six-layer FCM architecture

### Bridge System Features
- Automatic template generation from FCM definitions
- GitLab-specific adaptations (shell runners, job templates, artifacts)
- Metadata tracking with `.bridge-sync` files
- Master include file for easy integration

### Tested Components
- File operations: create, read, update, delete, copy, move, search
- Shell runner compatibility verified with GitLab Runner 18.1.0
- Python dependency installation with fallbacks
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline syntax validation

### Next Steps
- Implement remaining five FCM architecture layers
- Add composite operations and workflows
- Extend to more atomic operations from github.toolkit
